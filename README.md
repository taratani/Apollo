# Apollo
A web-based competitive music platform that allows users to upload original songs
and gain exposure by progressing through bracket-style tournaments. Users advance through each stage
of these tournaments by receiving the most votes by other users in that round. When users win a specic
tournament, they gain signicant exposure for their song through site acknowledgement as well as social
media publicity. This provides an engaging medium for both musicians and listeners to share new, high
quality music.
